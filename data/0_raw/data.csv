One answer lies in the administrative documents compiled after somebody’s death: in will (a schedule of where assets and goods should go and to whom) and “inventories” (a list of substantial goods owned by the deceased and their values).  Not all middling individuals would have had such documents compiled (and for many they may no longer survive), and the elite—including aristocratic men and women—also required such documents.  But the vast majority of those that survive for our period are testament to the “assets” of middling people.  The inventory shown here, for instance, records the material life of the Bristol sailor John Rockwell. The very existence of such an inventory implies that Rockwell had enough “things” in his life of value to warrant such a list being drawn up. These documents also show the variety of ways of marking “assets,” from “playing tables” like modern-day board games (LINK leisure) to debts owed by and to the deceased.  MORE

They were also sometimes carried on the person, as mobile effects demonstrating one’s worth and a ready offering of economic credit.  Such ownership transcends age and gender.

Such hornbooks are not only reserved for young and privileged men, but represent a household object that could help teach daughters or even servants and apprentices [LINK to LITERACY ACCT BOOK], especially in a household where literacy was experienced and absorbed collectively. Education in its various forms, in this case textual and literary, was a considerable asset, allowing individuals to work with words and numbers in a variety of professions, from painting or furniture-making (helped by the apprenticeship systems) to bookkeeping (a household as well as an occupational skill) to professional work in the medicine or the law (where it would have been supported by formal educational structures like the grammar school or university).  Such a hornbook also represents a middling asset in another sense: it indicates an educational investment in one’s children, furnishing them with textual skills for the future that will help them support a parent in older age or that can help ensure the “legacy” of the parents, suring up newly-achieved wealth and status or promising future advancement. Often, educational skills are an invisible asset—especially where they sit outside of formal school or university records or where individuals leave behind no written documents proving their literacy—but through items like hornbooks and through the skills made possible by such learning [LINK TO LITERACY BOARD ITEMS] the worth and significance of the many forms of learning available to middling children are abundantly clear.

The sword therefore represents the asset of “office”: a term used in the period to represent a formal position or role of one kind or another—here, a symbolic role at the heart of local government that brought its holder into close physical and social contact with the distinguished mayor of the city (especially during ceremonial occasions like pageants or mayor days).  Such offices also often gave the holder “livery”—recognisable clothing marking out their formal status. Similar positions conferred on their holders other items—maces for macebearers—whether held at home or kept safely in city property.  Less elaborately decorated swords were also part of the middling experience among those who did not hold such a position.  The sword was an especially symbolic item. Wearing one was supposed to represent “gentleman” status—a term reserved for noble men.  Yet increasingly in the period upper middling and middling men brandished them, prompting legislation to restrict their use, size, and appearance. They are sometimes synonymous with a martial masculinity in this period, though subversions or appropriations of this association find their way into national conversation--the real-life Moll Frith, or Moll Cutpurse, also dramatised in Middleton and Dekker’s The Roaring Girl, proudly wielded a sword in contravention of “sumptuary legislation” that prohibited it.  The sword’s symbolic importance extends to visual imagery [LINK TO LITERACY VISUAL], where ittypically represents justice.  At the same time, inevitably, they contain the threat of violence—something contentious in a period in which “duelling” (physical combat, typically between two men, over questions of honour) was broadly phased out and eventually outlawed completely in the seventeenth century.  Yet swords and smaller daggers were still the violent end of various middling figures from the period, as the “duel” or the violent scuffle was by no means confined to lords or knights. After all, playwright and poet Christopher Marlowe was killed over an argument about a restaurant bill with a small sword or dagger.

It was cast by Miles Graye I of Colchester, whose name is inscribed in the band around the top. Graye was part of a line of bell-founders based in the Essex town at a foundry on head street, but they made bells for both the local area (principally Essex, Sussex, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire) and for churches as far away as Newcastle. Bells were a significant part of the early modern soundscape and middling individuals would have important moments in their lives marked by their ringing at burials, marriages, and at festivals like Easter and Christmas. The sound would also mark the passing of time when very few people owned clocks. A surviving bell contract for a Salisbury founder, William Purdue, for St Thomas' church, demonstrates the care that some parishes took in making sure their bells were tuned to other churches in the locale asking that the set should be: 'found perfect & exactly tunable according to musicke within a quarter of a note as bigge or deep as the ringe of bells of St Edmonds parish [and that they] may be runge in compasse in peale runninge down sixe well tuned & musicall notes'. St Edmond's church also had bells made by another member of the Purdue family, so the decision by the neighbouring parish to have similar bells cast by a member of the same foundry was likely to have been deliberate, in order to generate a pleasant environment for residents. The dangers of too many bells being rung at once in a small geographical area are clear from a note in the Churchwardens' accounts of Christ Church, Bristol, where a memorandum declares that 'from hence forwards there shalbe no excessive ringinge but that which is necessarie & convenient', by which they mean festival days only. Middling men and women often donated money for the maintenance and casting of parish bells, with their contributions recorded in churchwardens' accounts and occassionally inscribed upon the bells themselves. Bells connect middling makers like the Grayes and Purdues to the parish church, middling communities, and charity, making them an exciting object through which  the middling can be seen as makers, benefactors, and listeners.",,

Not only was a child exposed to Christian doctrine through their education in reading, but also through a wider scheme of domestic and church devotional activities like praying, listening to sermons, enountering narrative wall-paintings, and through the instillation of gendered moral values.

He then taught at various schools, worked as a carpenter, studied astronomy and even spent time in prison (for possessing magic books). Forman is, however, remembered for his life as a physician because he kept notebooks known as 'casebooks' which detailed his patients, their ailments and their treatments. Forman held some quite unorthodox beliefs and he practised necromancy, pursued the philosopher's stone, and tried to communicate with angels. Despite this, he built a good reputation as a physician.

His casebooks detail his beliefs in action. For example, many patients complain of being 'bewitched', with issues such as lightheadedness, aches and injuries attributed to witchcraft.

Alcester Benefaction Board,Charity,Painting,Charity 1_Alcester benefaction board,Ruth Bubb Images,Alcester; benefaction board; joining/carving; painting; worshipping; displays of piety; prayer; devotion; charity; Memorial; remembrance,,"Benefaction boards are large, framed features in parish churches, which list the names of those who have performed exceptional acts of charity in their parishes. An individual would usually be listed if they gave lots of money or land in their will to their parish, or set up a free school, hospital, almshouse or workhouse. These boards were, then, set up in churches to record and memorialise key benefactors and notable acts of charity within the local community. The Alcester benefaction board is unusual in form and content – it is a triptych made up of a central panel, with two doors that open to reveal imagery inside. When closed the exterior displays painted inscriptions. When open four pictorial scenes showing charitable giving with relevant biblical texts are displayed, framing what would originally have been two parchments recording specific benefactions. Charity was an important aspect of daily life for those of middling status, who came into contact with boards like this one, which encouraged them to follow the example of their charitable peers, and pity the poor. Support for those less fortunate took a variety of forms, from institutions like hospitals, to the giving of money food and clothing, and to adopting children or offering them positions of service or apprenticeships. Middling sorts of individuals were key to the administering of charity within the parish, as wealthier men would usually take on positions like churchwarden, or overseer of the poor.

There are many examples within parish accounts of benefaction boards being purchased for display within churches. For example, an inventory for St Thomas’ Church in Salisbury for 1608 shows that there were ‘VII tables hanging about the churche’ some of which were likely to have held the names of benefactors (Wiltshire and Swindon Archives, 1900/92). In 1616, St Mary at the Tower church in Ipswich had ‘one timber table and one parchment table’ installed to record their benefactors (Suffolk Record Office, Ipswich Branch, FB1/E/1, 9r). The parchment table may have appeared like the one inside the Alcester Benefaction board, and could have been easily added to or replaced over time. 
Benefaction boards would also fill a void left by the Reformation, as saints were no longer worshipped, important parishioners could be recognised within church spaces instead. The Alcester Benefaction board therefore has three primary functions: to celebrate the charitable giving of parishioners, to encourage further giving, and to illustrate the impact of benefaction on the community with the four images. The top left-hand corner shows three tradesmen, a tailor, a carpenter and a butcher, giving to a collection for the poor. These three men are archetypes of middling tradesmen, who are asked in the extract from Psalm 41.1 to ‘consider the poor and needy’. The bottom left-hand image follows the common iconography of the poor because it depicts a blind man and a physically disabled man being given alms. These alms are in the form of clothing, food and drink, which were very common items given in charity. The third image is of a grammar school, probably Newport’s free school in Alcester, which was established in 1592 after the benefaction of Walter Newport of £400, for the teaching of ‘poor mens children’ (Cyril Johnston, Alcester’s Grammar School: the First Five Hundred Years (2012), p.10). Education was a means through which poor boys could be lifted out of poverty and gain the skills they needed to succeed as adults. The boys in this image are learning to read and write. The final image is of three women visiting prisoners to deliver bread. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, prisoners were required to pay for their own lodgings and sustenance, and so those who were already poor, in debt, or without familial support, would suffer without charitable support. Middling women are rarely depicted and their charitable acts are not as frequently celebrated as men’s, so this is a great example of the responsibility women also showed towards the poor. 
 
 This board was used long past its 1632 installation, as shown by the date on the front of the board of 1683. While no records relating to this board survive, other churchwardens accounts suggest how benefaction boards were updated. For example, St Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, 1641 churchwarden accounts record a payment to ‘Morgan the painter’ for ‘the new table and for writinge in Mr Harringtons guifte in the old’. Such maintenance likely explains the overpainting of this board in the 1680s, when the parchments were updated (Bristol Archives, P.St MR/ChW/1/d, p.186). As such, churchwardens seem to be keen to renew benefaction boards to make them relevant to their parishioners and to continue encouraging them to give.

This kind of wall decoration was common in the houses of the middling sort in the later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.

Rhyming couplets were memorable means through which moral messages could be spread.

St Mary’s Bramford, on the outskirts of Ipswich, is its home, at the top of the nave. The column to which the box is fixed is inscribed and painted with: “Remember the pore the scripture doth record what to them is geven is lent unto the lorde 1591”. This reminds the viewer that charitable actions in life would be important to achieving salvation. He box has a lock at the top to keep donations secure. These boxes encouraged wealthier members of a parish with loose change to give to the church. Churchwardens, who were often middling tradesmen, controlled funds from the poor box. This object represents the practice of short term, small benefactions to a parish, and the jurisdiction middling officeholders held over the distribution of poor relief at local level. 

[EXTENDED INFO]

Poor boxes were introduced in the mid-sixteenth century, during the reign of Edward I to encourage giving and, in Elizabeth’s reign, it was suggested that parishes should have:
a strong chest with a hole in the upper part thereof […] having three keys, whereof one shall remain in the custody of the parson, vicar, or curate, and the other two in the custody of the churchwardens, or any other two honest men […] which chest you shall set and fasten in a most convenient place, to the intent the parishioners should put into their oblations and alms for their poor neighbours. (https://history.hanover.edu/texts/engref/er78.html, XXV)
Churchwardens accounts of the period, testify to the existence of poor boxes throughout the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. For example, in Bristol, the churchwarden accounts of St Mary Redcliffe church for 1591 record payments to painter George Cowper (made a freeman of the city in 1566) ‘for painting the frame over the poores chest and for painting the chest’, to joiner William Keifte alias Beny for making the frame, and to a blacksmith for ‘a locke and three keayes for the poores cheste’ (Bristol Archives, P.St.MR/ChW/b, pp.242 and 244). The ‘three keys’ are in line with the Elizabethan injunctions, to be held by the ‘parson, vicar, or curate’ and the two churchwardens, who in Mary Redcliffe parish in 1591 were John Halliday and William Beny. Beny was also the tradesman who built the frame for the poor box, so was involved with the administration and making of this church object. Middling men like Halliday and Beny were, then, trusted to oversee the administration of church funds through given in the box and had clear responsibility over those less fortunate within their parish. 
An example of the poor box in use can be seen in the vestry minutes of St Thomas’ Church, Salisbury, in 1637. Here the churchwardens are described as working with the overseers of the poor in order to provide for the ‘sicke and necessitous poore of this parish’ from the box’s funds. The poor box ‘shall be opened in the presence of the minister and churchwardens and some of the aldermen of this parish’ – men trusted to manage the money given responsibly.  The donations given to the box would be very important in the managing of the poor within a parish, and represents a particularly middling way of giving small quantities of money to contribute to a collective effort. Middling sorts without large amounts of disposable income could still give to the box, and those at the bottom of this group might be acutely aware of the fact that they too may rely on the charity of their parish peers if they fell ill and were no longer able to work. 
Poor boxes were often inscribed with messages encouraging the importance of giving to charity. For example, a box 1634 at Ash Priors, Somerset has a brass plaque with the phrase ‘REMEMBER THE POORE’, and a 1639 box in Walpole St Peter in Norfolk has an identical inscription in oak. The messages on these boxes would work in conversation with benefaction boards within the parish church, which celebrated the most generous donors, to persuade those fortunate enough to have disposable income in the congregation to give. Often, these messages would be enhanced through sermons where the preacher would remind their parishioners of the importance of charity. The Elizabethan injunctions of 1559 also encouraged this, stating that the ‘parson, vicar, and curate’ had a duty to tell their parishioners that ‘to relieve the poor is a true worshipping of God’, and that it was a means of preparing for salvation.  
These objects did not only appear in parish churches, but also in other public buildings including town halls, hospitals and guilds. As such, these would have been very familiar objects to middling parishioners, who would have been reminded of their duty to help those less fortunate whilst negotiating their locale.

It also acts as a memorial to John Sayer, yeoman, who bequeathed lands to the parish in his will in order to provide bread and clothing to the poor every Sunday ‘for ever’. His bequest still generates money for the poor today. This represents longer term benefaction and the importance of food as alms for the poor in this period. Sayer gives a lot of land in his will, and writes that his bequest should be delivered in the chancel of the church. Inscriptions like this celebrate the benefaction of individuals, holding them up as an example to others in the parish. Many churches would have had bread shelves, with St. Mary’s church in Fordwich Kent, displaying bread shelves above the West door. St Thomas’ church Salisbury’s inventory of 1608 records two tables ‘to put the bread upon for the poor people’. Bread shelves demonstrate the practical means through which parish churches distributed food to the poor.

It is also a representation of his wider charitable acts: he employs poor boys of the parish in pinmaking, and bequeaths twenty dozen (120) loaves of bread to the poor in his will. This lectern is described as a ‘free gift’ which is an important echo of sermons about charity like Robert Allen’s The Oderifferous Garden of Charitie, where he writes that a gift must ‘be free and proceede of a liberall and franke mind’ (p.15) so that the giver does not expect anything in return. However, Wathen would have increased his profile in the parish with such an ostentatious and expensive gift, which would have been visible to his peers at Bible readings in the church.

","The portrait includes an inscription with the date 1594 and the age of the sitter - 60.  Joanna Smith was a benefactor of St Peter Mancroft Church in Norwich. Her portrait includes three specific objects on the left that clearly had some significance - a cushion, an intricate piece of lacework and a gold lamp[?]. It is likely the painting records these as gifts to the church.
The portrait is part of the Norwich civic portrait collection, which includes somewhere between 19 and 22 portraits of mayors and benefactors painted before 1640. These portraits celebrated particular individuals as examples of civic authority and responsibility. This particular portrait is unusual as it depicts a female benefactor rather than a male civic official, and celebrates her contribution to the parish community. 
Women benefactors commonly appear in documents, with, for example, Thomasine Harrington and Charity White of Bristol being celebrated in the ‘Ledger of Benefactions’ manuscript for St. Mary Redcliffe, Bristol, for generous bequests which provided bread for the poor across the city for ever.

","These two boards celebrate charity by combining portraiture with benefaction biographies. Each explain the nature of the bequests in the form of money and land to be used for the benefit of the parish ‘forever’. These memorialise a long term form of charity and encourage others to do the same, with ‘Go & do thou likewise’ written with a manicule like hand emphasising the phrase. The portraits of William Hurstcroft, Joseph Knowles and John Knowles display features common in civic portraiture. For example, the skull ‑ a momento mori motif, reminding the viewer to prepare for life beyond death. The boards are in the same style, which gives the impression that each man is from the same charitable stock. There is also a loyalty to the parish represented in the writing about Joseph Knowles, who despite becoming a London apprentice, still remembered his home parish in his will. Middling migration to cities was common during this period, with many individuals like Shakespeare still remaining connected to their homes. These boards combine many of the genres of this charity theme – portraiture, benefaction boards, and instruction or exemplar.

This woodcut represents one answer: the “Cotswold  Olympic Games,” instituted in the early seventeenth century—a festival of sports, cardplay, dancing, spectacle, and ceremony— brought together participants from across all genders and social backgrounds.  They were started by Robert Dover (on the horse at the front here), and included everything from chess to shin-kicking — as it was put in the collection of celebratory poems to which the woodcut belongs:
His mirth, his games, his engines, pleasing bee
To every sort of men, age, sex, degree. (E2r)
You can see many feats in the woodcut (horse-riding, throwing of coits, fencing, shin-kicking, hunting, dining, dicing, and tumbling—with a temporary “castle” placed spectacularly at the top-centre), more or less appropriate to different social stations and inclinations.  All were marked out by age, gender, and class:

And throw the sledge, and spurne the heavy barre

STC 25055.5; octavo size
",print; Samuel Ward; Ipswich; morality; virtue; reading; food/drink; sociability; ,?,"Leisure time in early modern England was a controversial subject that spanned moral, political, and religious debates.  The Ipswich preacher Samuel Ward, the town’s chief divine from 1605 to 1640, was an especially reformist figure.  His sermon against drunkards from 1622 found its way into print and proved popular, going through four editions in five years.  
Ward’s sermon is accompanied by a vivid woodcut that indicates the broader social critique contained within its moral and spiritual message.  The image contrasts an “old” England characterised by upright “knights” (represented by spur and stirrup), the bible, and the mace with “now”: a period seemingly corrupted by gaudy fashions (hence the ribbons on the leg), carding and dicing, and drinking and smoking.  These visions of recreational activity rely on middling individuals to remedy the situation, looking to magistrates, yeomanry, and various officeholders either to lead by example and by regulation, or conversely to institute festivities that uphold martial readiness alongside exercise, fun, and games.

The watering holes of the period broadly sat on a spectrum from alehouses (the “lowest” form of drinking establishment) to taverns and then the more elite inns. In reality, however, the lines were porous.  Indeed, middling and elite members of communities visited each type of space, though the tavern and especially the inn were more noticeably spots where business, administration, religious organisation, and leisure combined.

The idea of such emblem games is to spin the wheel (with the arrow pinned in) until it falls upon a random number, which directs you to that particular emblem within the book itself.  Wither explains that “If the letter M. be placed before the allotted Number; then, that Lot is proper onely to a Man: If W. stand before it, it is proper onely to a Woman: If there be no letter, it is indifferent to both Sexes”.  The company are then to read and interpret the emblem, which are supposed to speak to the player’s condition.  
Houses in this period were undergoing changes in their structure (sometimes known as the Great Rebuilding of the century following 1550), which meant the central, floor to ceiling “Great Hall” had a ceiling put in half way up with new rooms above. Middling houses combined commercial labour and domestic comfort, work and recreation, but with more rooms, it was possible to use some only for leisure or dining. Here, R.B. explains that the game would “well become” the hall, parlour, or dining room—in the same way as chess or table play (a board game like draughts).

Where the hugely influential early “advice columnist” Thomas Elyot (a writer of conduct literature) praises dancing or martial exercises as honest activities, he utterly condemns dicing as an “idle pastime.” Elyot was writing for both an aristocratic and a middling readership—targeting in particular those who get their living by the pen (through writing, advice, secretarial work, or tutoring) and the ways they might counsel leading statesmen.  This foundational text for aspirational middling clerics definitively states that dice are not profitable objects.
In spite of this sober advice, dice like these were everywhere in the period, and used by all.  Middling leisure items could therefore stretch from something as small as a single die to more elaborate and expensive items like virginals [link to skip].
Such tiny and inexpensive items are not recorded in inventories.  That makes it difficult to pin dice ownership with certainty onto those men and women who were wealthy enough to leave inventories behind them (as inventories were only taken of those who held at their deaths goods, property, and money of reasonable worth).  Yet the widespread nature of dicing; its appearance across the board in commentary, sermons, and advice literature; and the survival of archaeological artefacts mean that middling men and women would doubtless have engaged in diceplay—both in their homes and in taverns or inns.

The virginal was a popular courtly instrument and Elizabeth I is known to have been a good player, though increasingly throughout the period virginals are to be found in the households of a range of individuals beyond the courtly aristocracy.  As such, the elaborateness and craft of the items and their materials varied.  Especially well-crafted and lavishly decorated virginals would be the preserve of the aristocracy and above, but plainer or more vernacular items were within reach of the middling.

These bands were paid by the local authorities and played across a range of civic events, festivals, and government events.
The shawm or wait therefore represents a particular form of recreation: one closely associated with “official” holidays, state- or civic-sponsored celebrations such as Whitsontide, Midsummer, or Christmas, and the welcoming of important people into the town.  They also appeared at guild and quarter sessions dinners and entertainments, where they might have been made and played by those at the bottom of the middling scale, to those at the very top of it or beyond into the gentry.
“Waits” like this instrument and its player, Marten, therefore emphasise the public dimension of musical performance—the cross-community equivalent of the more private, domestic, or coterie virginal [LINK]. 
And they can offer early provincial examples of successful actor-entrepreneurship, in which financial and cultural status is bound up with early modern England’s vibrant leisure industry.

It advertises “rare dancing on the Ropes” by an “Irish Boy of eight years old,” a maid of 15, and “another Girl of four years of age,” who also “doth turn on the Stage.”  These “rare Activities of body” were to take place at the “Rose in winestreet” in Bristol, as the writing that fills the blank at the top of the bill makes clear.  The event is to be rounded off with the common narrative playlet or jig of Jack Pudding.
The breadth of play advertised here makes clear the abundance of performance (in the broad sense of the term) available to early modern men and women.  Where leisure could involve active engagement in sport, dicing and carding, or eating and drinking, it could also come from spectatorship or engagement in the porous activities of early modern theatrical venues. In any case, you had to pay to see the spectacles.
Playhouses and venues where “feats of activity” took place represent another leisure opportunity for the middling sort.  These spaces brought them into close interaction with influential officeholders and leading business-, trade-, and craftspeople, while providing professional entertainment. Such commercial spaces were also opportunities for middling proprietors, who used them for financial profit and political connections.

",Animal; London; playing; leisure; games; looking; performance,,"This is the skull of an adult female brown bear, and her eyes once stared out at crowds of people on London’s Bankside who had come to watch her engage in “sport” with dogs; it quite possibly, like many of its kin, travelled the country to other regions to ”perform.”  The commercial pastime known as “bearbaiting” was a major attraction in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England, in which a bear would be chained to a stake and dogs would be set upon it (and spectators would often bet upon the winners). 
Probably the most well-known bearwards of the period are the playhouse builder Philip Henslowe and his brother-in-law, the famous actor Edward Alleyn.  Alleyn is a prime example of how commercial entertainment can not only provide leisure for wide audiences but can offer substantial financial and social mobility for its proprietors. Similar such bearwards established themselves in other areas of the country, including one John Seckerston based in Nantwich near Chester (and who brought and possibly sold his bears as far south as Bristol).
Alleyn in particular, who leaves a great deal of textual evidence behind him, draws together the ends of entertainment with other typically middling characteristics—in particular a concern for benefaction and legacy alongside the broader significance of “play” for social and cultural ambition.  Indeed, by 1605, Alleyn had purchased the manor of Dulwich where he built his house as well as almshouses, a charitable school and its chapel. The early modern entertainment industry, of which Alleyn was a key innovator, brought him up from jobbing actor to successful “play” entrepreneur and then eventually further beyond into the landed, coat-of arms-bearing elite.

Visual Literacy,Literacy,Furniture,Literacy 1_chimney piece,Christ Church Museum Ipswich,chimney piece; narrative; Ipswich; home; decoration; sociability; looking,,"The term “literacy” refers most precisely to “the ability to read and write” and its extent within a “given community” (OED 1.) It also means, however, the ability to read in the broadest sense (OED 2.)—across a range of subjects or mediums (from written text to painted hangings).  Middling men and women are defined by the breadth and usefulness of their various literacies, some of which apply to craft skills (how to “read” quality distinctions or narrative engravings), some to leisure time (in books or parlour games), or in charitable acts (such as benefaction boards reliant on visual and textual memory) [LINKS].  In the widest sense, literacy defines the way working individuals navigated their professional, social, domestic, and recreational lives. 
This chimney piece, which would have sat in a property in Ipswich’s High Street, visually depicts a series of the 7 virtues. Early modern individuals were able to read and understand visual sequences, symbolism, and imagery to a highly sophisticated level, identifying symbols within each (such as the scales and sword of justice [LINK TO SWORD IN ASSETS]).  The level of recognition extends beyond what we might even recognize today, with highly attuned readings of iconography across all areas of life (on household goods, cloths, on buildings, or in performance, for instance); in other words, these are not simply a mode of storytelling for those unable to read letters and words, they have their own rich and complex meanings well understood, in particular by middling individuals who used visual imagery to furnish their spaces and goods. Indeed, middling individuals were well-situated to make iconography an aesthetic addition to the household.  The chimneypiece here represents an elaborate decoration of the domestic space above the fireplace, an area central to household activity and socialising.  The religious overtones of the virtues carry forward a particularly godly form of interior decoration, one that emphasizes good living and behaviour for those living in the house and advertises their piety to visitors. While religious changes after the Reformations of the 1530s and 1540s changed the reception of visual imagery, but it did not diminish its centrality to life: throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth century such visual details were a key part of literacy.

They also speak to collaborative practices, with household members as well as business associates working together to “reckon” debts and expenses.  Such account books also give a glimpse into the way written literacy was learned.  While traditional centres of learning like grammar schools taught formalised and classically-inspired methods of reading and writing, household dynamics centring on accounts meant that servants, apprentices, and young women could pick up numerical and textual skills. Legal testimonies from the period recount the experience of teenage girls, such as Mary de Clerk in Suffolk in 1573, observing her mother make accounts in a book such as this and detailing the methods and approaches required.  These account books are proof that acts of literacy for middling individuals in the period were both personal and communal, both part of public life and at the heart of the working (and learning) household.

This object is inkhorn, in which such ink would be stored. A quill  (like a modern pen) would be dipped into it before writing on the page. This one is made by a turner and is built to be portable, with a screw-on lid to keep the ink from drying out or leaking. Black ink was made of a mixture of galls (usually oak galls) and copperas (Iron II sulphate) and the chemical reaction that took place when these two substances mixed created the black colour. Other liquids formed the base of the ink: from wort to wine to aqua vitae to vinegar and to water. Then gum arabic was added in order to allow the ink to attach to paper. Writers had clear preferences for certain kinds of ink (examples of complaints of too watery ink - maybe Brinsley?), and many would experiment by making recipes at home. There are many thousands of printed and manuscript recipes for ink surviving for this period, demonstrating how the practice of its making was often home grown. Although many accounts (like the Bristol audits) demonstrate ink being purchased, it is rare to find an actual source for the substance before the mid-seventeenth century (Adrian Johns), and ink for writing was very different to the kind used in printing.

It is a “deed box,” made for storing shared documents in an organised fashion so that they could be easily located.

During this period there was an explosion in the number of records created by institutions and administrative bodies, who demanded sophisticated archiving systems. Stratford-Upon-Avon had a 'Cupboard of Boxes' made for them in 1594.. Often boxes were produced to house documents of various sizes, and they could be made waterproof with leather in order to safely transport text. This box is clearly labelled on the outside in black ink: ‘here in are the acquittanceis ffrom Worcester for the Vicars tenthes’. Such items as this box have an important place in our writing of the history of ordinary individuals, because they safely store written documents that become “history”: the Holmes family of Chester, for instance, copy out many of the documents stored in council-owned boxes like these, detailing their filing and archiving position in the building they’re stored in and explaining the significance of their contents.

The map had been around for a long time by the sixteenth century, but in the years that follow 1550 there is a huge expansion in the creation and availability of maps, which were printed and made available to middling individuals able to buy the pricey but not always prohibitive folio books they were printed in.  At the heart of the expansion in mapmaking were professional middling men like William Smith, who drew this map of Bristol while touring the country writing a “Lonely Planet” guide about local places and features.  Smith was trained in drawing coats of arms, but his interest in drawing extended to other pursuits.  Here, his detailed manuscript sketch falls into a recognisable model of Elizabethan and Jacobean geographies, and maps similar to this become particularly popular when John Speed’s famous maps of the period became more readily available in print.  These images offer new ways to think about space and movement, marking out key points in an urban setting and laying out road networks. They also speak to civic pride and history, creating mythologies and reputations about the locations they represent: here, using the shield with a ship in the top right, Bristol’s coat of arms, to emphasise its independent city status, while  depicting its burgeoning overseas trade power and incipient slave trade via the small ships. Such maps were made by middling individuals interested in local history and in finely describing and demarcating different regions in an emerging English national identity, and they were consumed by elite and middling viewers alike.

The essay, like the sermons (one of the most popular print market forms), found its way into print in London and would likely have been available there and perhaps also in the north west or elsehwere by any peddlers selling reasonably affordable religious pamphlets like these.  Byfield, the preacher who wrote the essay, builds in further local connections beyond London. He dedicates the essay to Jane Ratcliffe, a prominent middling resident of Chester.  Ratcliffe was the daughter of Robert Brerewood, a “self-made man” who made a substantial fortune and amassed political capital (including two mayoralties) in the area through his trade as a glover [LINK TO GLOVES ASSETS].  The Ratcliffe family Jane married into were also substantial local figures who held positions of mayor and rose to prominence as brewers.  Jane Ratcliffe was also the dedicatee of another pamphlet by John Ley about “pious” living.  This print publication therefore exemplifies how local questions of status can reach a national audience, and it encapsulates a particular idea of middling propriety: the industrious, religious, and well-behaved wife from a respectable family background.  Through texts such as this, very particular local ideas of social status begin to align with a developing national idea of “middling” behaviour.

Diary,Memory,Manuscript,Memory 1_Thomas Greene,"Shakespeare Birthplace Trust,BRU15/13/26a recto",manuscript; civic; recording; writing; self-fashioning; remembrance; office-holding; stratford-upon-avon,https://shakespearedocumented.folger.edu/resource/document/thomas-greene-s-notes-progress-proposed-enclosures-welcombe-include-five,"Memory prompts came in many forms during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and were contained within objects and texts. These remembrances, memorials, chronicles and memoranda gestured to collective historical or biblical events and people, or individual matters like lists of debt or small reminders. 
  
The wealthiest middling sorts of people within a locale held positions of office within their communities in which they’d be part of the production of records for remembering legal, political, cultural and financial information for their locale. In 1538, parishes were required to keep a parish chest with registers of births, marriages and deaths within their communities. This kind of record keeping was replicated by guilds and corporations, and these documents generated spatially situated narratives in which a locale or institution was celebrated. 
  
Remembering people, places, institutions or events was a means through which the past was brought into the present through objects, memorials and texts. Prominent individuals and events could be preserved in the memory of a locale through memorials. These objects could also hold didactic qualities; teaching moral values like charity, good governance or preparing for life after death. A good reputation was essential to middling families’ authority and identity within a community, and reminders of exceptional individuals within a locale, ancestors or important events, would recall the importance of living well.  
  
Many of the objects within this theme hold multi-layered meanings as memory-prompts. Some combine the national, local and familial, whilst some recall Biblical stories or ways in which someone should live. 

Image 1: Thomas Greene's Diary

This first object is an example of a diary compiled between 1614 and 1615 in Stratford-upon-Avon by Thomas Greene, the town clerk and steward. Unlike modern diaries, which focus on inner thoughts and feelings, Greene’s is more concerned with external events (which was very common in diaries of this period, Smyth, p.434). He records his participation in the town corporation’s fight against the enclosure of the common fields in order to remember his conversations and actions during this time. Enclosure was the dividing up of and privatisation of land by estate owners. Landowners would build ditches and fences, then turn land for crops into fields for grazing livestock. This would generate more profit for them, but would cause poverty in the local area because it would deprive people of work gathering crops, and prevent them from using land which was once common fields for generating food or keeping their own livestock. In Stratford-upon-Avon, it also led to the depopulation of the village of Welcombe causing hardship to those that once lived there, who were cast out of their homes by landowners.

","Momento mori (remember death) motifs were very common in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. These two rings are examples of remembrance jewellery which was often bequeathed in wills, where a testator would give money for them to be made for friends and family (Evans, English Posies, p.xxvii). The ring containing a skull is made of gold, which was a material only accessible to the wealthiest upper middling status individuals in a community. It holds the inscription ‘DIE TO LIVE’ to remind the wearer of life beyond death. The other ring is made of copper, a cheaper material which mimicked gold in its appearance (though would tarnish over time to a green-blue colour). This kind of ring would have been accessible for a many people of middling status, whilst still being a very special item, and may have been one of the only pieces of jewellery owned by an individual. Like Greene’s diary, these rings have both a personal function (remembering friends and family past) and a public purpose to display a person’s wealth and focus on leading a good life to their communities.

William Smart held multiple offices during his life including: treasurer, coroner, claviger, a member of the council of twelve, portman, justice, bailiff and treasurer of Christ’s hospital. He was a merchant who was connected to the cloth trade, and was very charitable, something that is gestured at in his memorial in the line: ‘schools, churches orphanarye rooms shal keepe ye still in sight’. By using his name as the basis for the acrostic, the memorial gives the sense of Smart embodying the qualities within the verse. Smart is also depicted on the bottom right of the memorial, knelt in prayer and wearing his civic regalia. Those admiring the memorial would see Smart as an exemplary, godly individual through the combination of word and image.

This cupboard was kept on the first floor, alongside other storage devices, and facilitated the reference and retrieval of information by town officials. This cupboard, then, acted as a memory aid for the town’s corporation, by enabling documents to be stored in logical order. Muniments stored and created within a town were important to the establishment of a company’s authority. Robert Tittler has argued that good governance ‘often depended on its [the town’s] ability to produce the right documents in court’ meaning that the ‘safe and secure preservation’ of documents was essential. Furnishings, such as this cupboard, materially underpinned records generated by educated administrators responsible for the reputation of their locale. For men involved in civic governance, writing was an important tool through which they could craft a perception of their town, have legal and political influence, and create a lasting legacy through documentary evidence.

Addams writes this in Bristol, his home city, and begins it in 1625, though some of the content is much later. He was a draper of the city, so a tradesman, but was also highly literate and writes with an italic hand common by the mid-seventeenth century. He writes in the introduction that he ‘penned’ it for his ‘delight and helpe of memory’ and ‘to stop the mowthes of foolish people, that will talke what a merry world it was in former ages’.

","Migration of various kinds is crucial to understanding the cultural lives of the middling sort. This image depicts an excavated furnace, established sometime in the 1580s, in Eccleshall in Staffordshire.  Such furnaces represent the physical and economic stamp made on England by glassmakers from across Europe.  Among the most important of such glassmakers, Jean Carrè, born in France and trained in Antwerp—a Huguenot (French Protestants persecuted by the Catholic powers)—moved to England in 1567.  Glassmaking was a relatively small-scale and undeveloped craft in England in this period, and the government accordingly issued Carrè and his partner, Anthony Becku, a monopoly on glass production.  They set up their shop in the Weald in Surrey and Sussex, building furnaces, and produced window glass as well as Venetian-influenced glassware.  Carrè’s techniques would set up a new industry in the Weald and give rise to what is generally termed “Wealden glassmaking,” helping establish a new technology and industry in England.

Sheldon Tapestries,Mobility,Textiles,Mobility 2_Sheldon,"T.7b-1961 © Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge
",,,"European migrants brought a whole range of skills to England. Like Carré, Richard Hyckes travelled from the Netherlands to work in England as a tapestry weaver. This woven cushion cover shows scenes from the life of Tobias, and at almost a metre long it was probably used in a window seat in an elite house. The distinctive style is referred to as “Sheldon”, indicating manufacture in a small town  in the midlands in Warwickshire, under the management of William Sheldon.  This attribution has been challenged by recent scholarship that has demonstrated how involved immigrant craftspeople were in the production, design, and manufacture of the so-called “Sheldon” tapestries.  A large number of émigré weavers came to England in the later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, in particular from Flemish areas in the continent. Recent research has indicated the centrality of Richard Hyckes to the production of these tapestry weavings and to the work of Sheldon and his manufacturing scheme. The production of woven cloth, with intricate patterns, like this one, which would have been a prized aesthetic feature for elite homes, is therefore testament to the skill and labour that comes from European immigration.

",,British library website,"This draft proclamation of 1601 provides clear indication that there was a sizeable population in England of people who were not “white,” in our contemporary expression. Research into the lives of black men and women has demonstrated that “middling” is not synonymous with “white,” and that titles such as “haberdasher,” “musician,” “silkweaver,” “soldier,” “royal page,” or “diver” could and were held by those of various different races (see Imtiaz Habib, 4). All swathes of English society would therefore be aware of, and many living alongside, middle-eastern, African, and Asian individuals in a period when the notion of “race” was being shaped and reinvented. These individuals also supported middling identity as craftspeople: in Bristol in the 1560s, the prominent citizen Sir John Young “did appointe a blacke moore to keep possession of his garden” (Habib REF) (the TIDE project provides detailed definitions for the racial vocabulary of early modern England, including the term “blackamoor,” LINK).  Many middling men and women, particularly those who were literate, might then be closely engaged in discursive ideas of race, as they read descriptions of the new world by writers such as Hakluyt, encountered its theatrical representations in plays by Peele or Shakespeare, sometimes while working and living alongside black craftspeople.

They were broadly known in England as “Cologne ware,” indicating a deep connection between this everyday object and its (vague) location on the continent.

","This unusual image, which appears on the surface like a crude drawing, is in fact the traced outline of a “watermark” from a piece of early modern paper.  Watermarks were present in all sheets of paper produced in the period, and they identify its origins and makers.  The Gravell Watermark Archive, from which this image is taken, informs us that this sign was present in paper produced in Colmar in 1593, by the St Albantal paper mill.  The literate men and women would have precisely such paper to write on, read, print upon, and re-use for bindings—with a high likelihood it would be imprinted, as here, with a watermark from a French papermill.  Indeed, James Daybell notes that 98% of paper used in English printed and manuscript sources came from a French source.  As such, images like this—along with unicorns, wheels, grapes, fleur-de-lis, and various arms—would have been a familiar aspect of one’s existence, and a daily, even hourly, encounter for those working closely with paper items.

Movement across and within different areas of England is therefore a crucial experience for middling men and women: those who worked often travelled for various reasons, often to London—to appear at court, to collect materials, or on professional or social calls.  Similarly, those in provincial communities such as Bristol, Ipswich, or Chester relied on the movement of goods and information throughout the country.  The postal service was a key element in keeping communications flowing—through letters or through the delivery of goods.  This letter therefore indicates how news and official business might spread throughout the realm, providing crucial legal information for those in local governmental or legal offices (by instructing them how to do their jobs) and for the wider society, newly appraised of changes in the law.

In 1607, the ship returned to England and likely continued to deliver and trade goods across the seas.  The ship represents a key factor in the English economy—as a merchant trading vessel that made possible the many exchanges of paper, wine, spices, and raw materials that were central to early modern life.  It also speaks to the colonialist project emerging in early modern Europe, with this ship in particular notable for its colonisation of the Americas.  In addition, the ship speaks to the burgeoning slave trade (for which many notable English sailors and merchants, such as John Hawkins, were responsible).  These vessels made possible contact not only with trading neighbours such as France but with areas as far afield as the West Indies and China.  Many of the wealthier individuals of early modern England direclty profited from the trading activities and ventures of these ships and their crew—either by their involvement as merchants or through “joint-stock organisations” such as the East India Company—and others benefited indirectly from the goods that passed through the land and made possible labour from cooking to woodworking.  Such boats therefore represent a key influence on innovation and activity, but they also mark out the often violent, destructive, and ongoing legacy of early imperial action.

","Quills (early modern pens) were commonplace tools for writers in early modern England. They were made from feathers, principally from medium-sized birds like geese and swans. Once the feathers had been plucked from the wing, they would be laid to rest and harden before being shaped with a knife. Scribes would have varying preferences for the shape of their pen, depending upon their script, whether they were right or left handed, and whether they wanted to create thick or thin pen strokes. Quills had hollow centres which made them perfect for taking up ink after being dipped in an ink well. Middling men and women would have been very familiar with this tool and were likely to use them for (at least) signing and marking their names, but also for writing correspondence, keeping accounts and writing bills and receipts. Professional middling men who worked as lawyers, doctors, scriveners, clerks or in creative roles like playwrights would have used many hundreds of these pens in their lifetimes in the creation of books and documents. Not many of these quills survive, so this rate fragmented example at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust stands for the millions of these pens that were used during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries!

He was clearly tremendously wealthy at the time of his death with his inventory valued at £2457 which is the equivalent of £323,144.64 in today's money or 49140 days work for a skilled tradesman, according to the National Archives' currency converter. Throppe sat among the wealthiest citizens in the city, and was so successful that he gained a coat of arms in his lifetime and became mayor.

Lenard Fireback,Occupation,Furniture,Occupation 9_fireback,,,,"Cast-iron firebacks were produced in England from the first half of the sixteenth century and served to protect the back of chimneys and reflect heat back into the room. As domestic buildings increasingly incorporated chimneys these functional accessories were in demand and gradually the plain iron plates were embellished with imagery, including heraldry and biblical subject matter.[1]Among the collection of iron firebacks at Anne of Cleve’s House in Lewes, Sussex, is a personalised fireback dated 1636 depicting Richard Lenard, who succeeded his father as tenant of the iron foundry at Brede in 1605.[2]
This object is a form of annotated portrait – Lenard stands in the centre of the composition with a hammer in his hand and along the top rim are the words RICHARD LENARD FOVNDER AT BRED FOURNIS. Museum listings usually describe this object as representing ‘the tools of his trade’ but Lenard’s fireback is not simply an advertisement of his trade; the imagery appears to place his identity between the spheres of domestic and business interests.
On the right-hand side of the panel is depicted an ornate fireplace complete with its own fireback (with his initials R. L.) and a display of drinking vessels above. A faithful dog leaps to greet his owner.
On the left-hand side are the tools of Lenard’s business operation; a brick furnace with a wheelbarrow above containing charcoal and, in the top left-hand corner, a shield bearing a blacksmith’s hammer, bell and andiron.
Lenard straddles these spheres dressed in what appears to be a nightgown, with its tie and lace collar – a garment worn in the evenings by those who had access to leisure time. There is a striking incongruity in the combined accoutrements of robe and hammer but this meeting of symbols represents Lenard’s self-fashioned identity as that of a well-to-do member of society, proud to exhibit the skills of his trade but equally keen to signal the range of quality possessions furnished by his successful business. This seemingly humble object employs a common language of visual signifiers, such as trade tools, high-status domestic objects and distinctive clothing, which were also used in heraldry as bearings to identify the social rank and qualities of armigerous individuals or institutions.
This pseudo-heraldic personal emblem constructs a social identity for Lenard that cannot be defined as distinctively commercial or domestic in nature, but encompasses both. This fluidity and inter-dependence between spheres may be considered a defining characteristic of middling identity and culture – Lenard exhibits pride here in the mastery of his craft that contributes to the quality of his clothing and domestic furnishings. But at the same time his social status could augment the desirability of his products. The goods he creates and sells are themselves domestic objects placed at the heart of the home, the hearth, with opportunity for bespoke designs – initials, dates and imagery – to reflect and construct individual and social identities within a shared culture of objects and symbols. Presumably this particular demonstration of the products that could be crafted at Brede would have appealed to other middling tradesmen who fashioned themselves in terms of lifestyle as much as occupation.

  ‘Mr Dover Verses’/ In the name of Mr Hill/ To the Bayliffs of Tewkesbury/ The day they answerr 

Hannah's transcription (excuse typos)

From Kent History and Library Centre U269/F36 (Lionel Cranfield's Papers)

William Hill acted at Town Clerk for Tewkesbury for much of his adult life, and also as Lionel Cranfield's estate steward on his Forthampton estate and deer park. This verse libel, in the form of an acrostic, was discovered by Robert Dover's son in the place of a window pane in the room where Hill stayed when visiting Cranfield's residence, Milcote House in Warwickshire. It caricatures the bailiff's of Tewkesbury's indulgences, painting them as drunkards who would wine and dine before their 'halls' (meetings) and so dull their ability to make important decisions. This is a pretty scandalous libel against the town governors, potentially by a professional middling man. Public crafting of identities...

Of course no proof William Hill did actually write this, could have been RObert Dover himself attempting to discredit him.

Slander,Reputation,Manuscript,Reputation 2_slander,"British Library Harley MS 4064, fol.189r",,https://shakespearedocumented.folger.edu/file/harley-ms-4064-folio-189-recto,"On the 16th July 1613 Susanna Hall, Shakespeare's daughter, and wife to John Hall went to the consistory court at Worcester and filed a slander suit against John Lane, who had accused her of committing adultery with John Lane. Slander was a very serious threat to a middling men and women, because it could destroy their reputation within their community making it very difficult for them to gain positions of responsibility and to be favourably perceived. Going to the consistory court was one way through which women could clear their names and restore their good social standing. Susanna claimed that she had not lain with Raffe Smith, and John Lane missed the court date. Susanna was proven innocent in court and had her name cleared, but John Lane was excommunicated. Therefore, Lane's slander backfired causing him far more reputational damage than Susanna. 

I don't think all of this is on Shakespeare Documented yet. I got some info from the Shakespeare's World website, but would be good to check whole documentation at some point: https://www.exploreshakespearesworld.com/shakespeares-world-app/why-did-susannah-file-a-lawsuit-for-slander-in-1613/

","Seal ring with the inscription W.S. Connects to literacy – uses in correspondence/ wills. Middling men and women sought to invest in items which displayed their status and the particularly wealthy members of this group invested in jewelry which would signify their wealth to those around them. A ring such as this would have been a significant asset to an upper middling man and could craft his reputation as a literate, wealthy individual with enough documents to seal to make such an investment worth it. Men and women of this status level often bequeathed rings in their wills to close friends and family members (most frequently of 20s worth), meaning that certain individuals were gifted items like these from their broader social network, who sought to maintain social status within this group.

Clothing,Reputation,Clothing,Reputation 6_Thomas Bell,Gloucester Folk Museum,,https://www.artuk.org/discover/artworks/thomas-bell-14861566-62324,"Clothing was an important means through which middling men and women expressed their identities. This portrait is of Thomas Bell of Gloucester, who was mayor of the town three times between 1535 and 1554. He was a capper by trade and employed many other men in his business, and the inscription on his portrait explains that he 'did wel for the poore provide'. His clothing in this portrait would have been immediately recognisable to men and women of all status groups as belonging to a town governor (mayor, bailiff or alderman). He wears a scarlet gown with a fur trim, which would have been a very expensive item of clothing, and would have carried significance as a traditional 'uniform' worn by leaders and would communicate the wearer's civic importance to those around them. The wearer of such a scarlet gown would also have achieved an excellent reputation in their town, and wearer's would also communicate their trustworthiness and moral service to their community.

His poetry: 'A Poets Vision and a Princes Glorie' published in 1602, the same year he was called to the bar. He calls himself a 'gentleman' on the cover, marking his new identity after gaining a legal education. Having the reputation of a 'gentleman' could afford someone of middling status certain privileges with regards to responsibilities within their communities, but the title did not necessarily always denote gentry status, with some of these men living like their middling peers: working for a living, being neither very rich nor very poor, and not holding a coat of arms.
